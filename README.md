# Variabilty_FCR_fDOM_MS_Code
R Scripts used in Howard et al. Variability in fluorescent dissolved organic matter concentrations across diel to seasonal time scales is driven by water temperature and shortwave radiation in a eutrophic reservoir

EDI_data_comp_final.R is used to compile data from EDI into csv used for Wavelet and AR time series analyses (EDI links given in manuscript)

Wavelets_for_fDOM_final_plots_lr.R is used to conducted continuous wavelet transforms and create plots and analyze results 

13_ARlag_daily_monthly_final.R is used to determine appropriate time lag for daily and monthly fDOM AR analyses and generates csvs used for final AR analysis 

15_correlation_coefficents_fDOM_daily_monthly_final.R is used to create Spearman correlation tables to determine appropriate drivers for AR analysis 

16_lm_interactions_fdom_daily_monthly_final.R is used to conducted final AR analysis, analyze results, and create plots
